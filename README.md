Term: Fall 2022


+ Projec title: Emotion Analysis on the dataset
+ This project is conducted by Chaitanya Shah

+ Project summary: My idea behind this project is to analyze the emotions in different texts across schools and authors. My goal is to see if the information in the data coincides with my own understanding of different schools and also to find some interesting obeservations. I also plan to conclude what type of texts might be present in each school of thought based on my analysis.
